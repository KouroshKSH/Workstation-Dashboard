## Introduction
 The _Workstation Dashboard_ is a Java-based program designed to serve as a centralized platform for managing and processing data related to trading activities. The program offers various features, such as handling multiple accounts, reading from text files, and pre-stored data, writing and appending new data, displaying information in table form and text fields, and more.

The program consists of two main parts:
1. **The Login Phase:** This is where users must provide their username and password to access the system. Once authenticated, the system stores and manages information respective to the signed-in account.
2. **The Main Terminal:** This is the window which serves as the landing page of the program. This landing page offers unique functions and features based on the access limitations of each individual user.

Before accessing the program, users must first login with their credentials. To facilitate this process, a couple of users and employees have been inserted into the `personelData.txt` file. The program includes multiple exception handling cases, from having the text fields empty to mismatching username and passwords or invalid inputs. After the initial login phase, users are directed to the main page based on their position in the company. This page is customized to offer specific features and functions depending on the user's access level.

Overall, the _Workstation Dashboard_ provides a secure and efficient way for businesses to manage and process trading-related data.
